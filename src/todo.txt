TODO:

- we need to reset the moved entity's physics state after moving them using the gizmo (currently it keeps the momentum)
- bug: entity creation order interferes with selection
- bug: we can grab gizmo on the frame we select the entity
- bug: we can grab gizmos while already grabbing one
- default physx values are way too moon like
